# Taxi service

Taxi service is a Java project for client for working with server and database. This is my pet project. 
Client can log in with browser and use primitive user interface to work with data from db. Client can add, update, 
delete, get data from db.

## Installation

```
1. Fork and copy this project
2. Install MySQL
3. Use init_db.sql to create db
4. Change data in util class ConnectionUtil to connect your db
5. Install Tomcat and run the server
```

## Usage

Open browser, go on request http://yourlocalhost/ . At the beginning you can only log in or register account. 
When you log in then you will be redirected to navigation page. There you can go on different pages to add, delete, 
get, change data.
